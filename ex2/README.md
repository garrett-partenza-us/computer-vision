#### To Do
1. Custom Method 
- Detecting grass in images. Write a Canny edge detection algorithm (maybe in python first) and state that images with more egdes are more likley to be grass.
2. Extension
- Detect circles in images using [Hough Transform](https://sbme-tutorials.github.io/2018/cv/notes/5_week5.html#algorithm).
