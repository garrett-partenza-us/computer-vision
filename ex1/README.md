#### Project Description
This project aims to get familiar with the C++ and OpenCV interface. The project reads a video file and streams frames to the user in a pop-up window. Additionally, 10 key-stroke functions have been developed to enable the user to filter the video stream in real time. All functions were implemeented from scratch to understand the filtering first principles.
